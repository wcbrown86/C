In this section I am showing my work from a class dedicated to parallel and distributed computing. 
This class focused on the concepts and tools used to attempt to make programs more efficient. 
A common problem looked at in this class was a numerical integration problem. We used this problem 
to show how different methods of parallel and distributed computing. Each assignment has a PDF file 
that outlines what that assignment was suppose to achieve. Each part of the assignment has a 
MakeFile that was used to test and deploy the program. Each program was benchmarked on a remote server 
cluster housed at UNCC. To see the outcomes of each assignment check the plots folder to show a visual 
representation of the speedup achieved with each assignment in comparison to the provided sequential 
version of the same program. Any missing parts of the assignments were left out because they were not 
complete or did not produce the correct output.
